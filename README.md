# lesson 2 part 1

ðŸŒŸDatabinding is not mandatory for simple apps, it is a recommended pattern that makes your code simpler and easier to read.

ðŸ“ŒData binding generates the Binding object at compile time for all views in the layout

ðŸ“ŒAccessing views through the Binding object is more efficient than using findViewByID

ðŸ“ŒFor complex view hierarchies, data binding can be a significant performance gain

ðŸ“ŒfindviewbyID traverses the view hierarchy at runtime to find a view every time it's called IN OTHER WORDS - slows down the app if this is used instead of view binding ~

ðŸ˜‚bonus discovery: I cannot spell binding properly without autocorrection... yay me
