    <string name="bio">Hi, my name is Sophie.
        \n\n I love sports and outdoor activities
        \n\n my favourite sports are swimming and ice hockey. They are both very refreshing.
        \n Fun fact is that one of my favourite aquatic animals and my favourite hockey team have the same name
        \n\n I also love aquatic animals. Penguins and dolphins are examples.
        \n Penguins are very chubby and remind me that it\'s okay to fall down as long as you stand up again.
        \n Dolphin are very cheerful animals, watching them makes me happy.
        \n It would be great if I could swim with dolphins and hug a penguin one day
        \n\n Once when I was in the Vancovuer Aquarium I almost adopted a penguin because it was so adorable
        \n\n I love to ice skate as much as I love swimming and any other outdoor activity or team sport.
        \n\n I would love to be on your team! \n\n </string>
